# RETRO CARNAGE

The goal of this project is to build a modern multi-directional scrolling shooter - a worthy successor of the classic 1989 video game [Dogs of War](https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/41090) by [Elite Systems](http://www.elite-systems.co.uk).

## Status

This game is currently under active development. At the moment you can test different concepts of the game. But there is no gripping gameplay at the moment. 

## Try it out

An unfinished game does not deter you? Then you can find the current state of development on the official homepage of the game:  
[http://www.retro-carnage.net](http://www.retro-carnage.net). 

From time to time there is also a new video on Youtube that demonstrates the new features: [![Watch the video](images/youtube-first-impression.png)](https://youtu.be/W5dJvoZUGt8)
