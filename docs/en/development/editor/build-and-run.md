# Build and run

## Install toolchain

First of all, you should install the necessary tools on your computer to be able to work with the source code. You will need [git](https://git-scm.com/), [Java](https://openjdk.org/), and [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/index.html). 

## Get and build the source code

Get the code and assets

`git clone https://github.com/Retro-Carnage-Team/retro-carnage-editor.git`  

Change into the src directory

`cd retro-carnage-editor`

Open the project folder in NetBeans

`netbeans .`

NetBeans should now have the project open for you. You can right click on the project in the "Projects" view on the left. Select "Clean and Build" from the context menu. To start the editor press F6.

## Running the tests

Run the steps to install the development environment first (see previous chapter). Then press Alt+F6 to run the tests.
